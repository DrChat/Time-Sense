## Introduction
It'd be nice to have a meter of how much my time is spent where when I use my computer.
Android already has [something like this](https://wellbeing.google/).

It'd be nice if we can get something like this on Windows. A breakdown by process, active window, and time spent using each.

I also know for a fact that I spend the most time in Chrome browsing the internet, so it'd be nice to further break it down by window titles so I can differentiate between websites browsed.
